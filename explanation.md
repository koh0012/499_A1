## Individual Github Exercise

For this simple program, customized linked list was used as a data structure. The element of the linked list is Customer object with string and integer attributes.

The program will add names and their respective loyalty value (from 0 to 3) to the linked list. - Expected Input

Once all inputs are added to the linkedlist all elements in the list should be ordered by the loyalty value in increasing order. - Expected Outputs
Similiary, if one of the elements from the list is removed, the elements should be ordered by the loyalty value.
If the program attempts to add an element with invalid loyalty value, a error message will be displayed.

6 tests were run to test the output. The linkedlist behaved as it should, and passed all of the unit tests.
